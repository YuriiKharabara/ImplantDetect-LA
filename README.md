# ImplantDetect: Automated Dental Implant Detection using Linear Algebra Techniques (ImplantDetect-LA)
ImplantDetect-LA is an automated dental implant detection system that utilizes linear algebra techniques to analyze dental X-ray images. The primary goal of this project is to help dental practitioners quickly and accurately assess the presence and quantity of dental implants in patients, leading to improved dental care.

## Features
Preprocessing of dental X-ray images for feature extraction
Application of linear algebra techniques (SVD and PCA) for image analysis
Detection and counting of dental implants in X-ray images
Evaluation and optimization of the model's performance
Getting Started
These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the following software installed on your local machine:

Python 3.7 or later
Git
Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/ImplantDetect-LA.git
```
2. Change to the project directory:
```bash
cd ImplantDetect-LA
```

3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install the required packages:
```bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage
1. Add your dental X-ray images to the data folder.
2. Run the main script to preprocess the images, extract features, and detect dental implants:
```bash
python main.py
```
3. Check the output folder for the processed images and detection results.
